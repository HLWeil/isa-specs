This specification is a draft, and should be treated as a work-in-progress.

This document specifies version 1.0 of `ISA metadata framework`_, to manage an
increasingly diverse set of life science, environmental and biomedical experiments that employing one or a
combination of technologies. Built around the ‘Investigation’ (the project context), ‘Study’ (a unit of research)
and ‘Assay’ (analytical measurement) general-purpose Tabular format, the ISA tools helps you to provide rich
description of the experimental metadata (i.e. sample characteristics, technology and measurement types,
sample-to-data relationships) so that the resulting data and discoveries are reproducible and reusable.

Here, we provide a minimum specification for the ISA abstract model, and the two main formats that the ISA developers
currently maintain. For fuller explanations of how ISA is used, and the tool ecosystem around the ISA formats, please
visit the `ISA-tools.org`_ website.
