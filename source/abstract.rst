This specification currently a draft, and should be treated as a work-in-progress.

This document specifies v2.0 of `ISA metadata framework`_, to manage an
increasingly diverse set of life science, environmental and biomedical experiments that employing one or a
combination of technologies. Built around the 'Investigation' (the project context), 'Study' (a unit of research)
and 'Assay' (analytical measurements) abstract data model, ISA helps you to provide rich
descriptions of experimental metadata (i.e. sample characteristics, technology and measurement types, sample-to-data
relationships) so that the resulting data and discoveries are reproducible and reusable.

Here, we provide a minimum specification for the ISA Abstract Model (v1.0), and specifications for the two main data
formats that the ISA developers currently maintain (ISA-Tab v2.0 and ISA-JSON v1.0). For fuller explanations of how
ISA is used, and the tool ecosystem around the ISA formats, please visit the `ISA-tools.org`_ website.
