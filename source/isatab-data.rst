Data files and ISA-Tab archives
===============================

ISA-Tab focuses on structuring experimental metadata; raw and derived data files are considered as external files.
The Assay file can refer to one or more of these external data files. For guidelines on how to
format these data files, users should refer to the relevant standards group or reference
repository. In addition to raw and derived data files, the Assay file for gene
expression (measurement) by microarray (technology) will also refer to a Derived Array Data Matrix and an Array
Description File (ADF), both described in the MAGE-TAB specifications.

For submission or transfer, ISA-Tab files and associated data files can be packaged into an ISArchive, a zip file
containing all the files together.
